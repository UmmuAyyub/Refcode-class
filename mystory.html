<h1>This is my developer story.</h1>
<ol type="A">
  <li> as a child, we didn't have a computer at all so I had no idea what exactly computer is.</li>
<li>in high school, I took basic computer class which was one of the mandatory classes.</li>
<li>Back then I wasn't interested in knowing more about computers rather than just being able to type faster than my classmates.</li>
 <li>when my math teacher voluntarily taught how to make  games  using computers, I have always used to wonder “how?” “how do they do all these animations, and build websites?”</li>
<li>but never attended the class because I thought am not suitable for it.</li>
<li>now I have been interested about computers, how they function, and get answers to my questions more than ever.</li?
